Tutorial
========

This is the place to start. It's suggested that you follow its sections in
order. That's why the Table of Contents here is *numbered*, using the
``:numbered:`` option (you can view the code to see how it's used) - it's the
only numbered Table of Contents in this project.

Each section of the tutorial covers a sequence of practical steps, is
self-contained and assumes a minimum of knowledge and experience. See the :ref:`about-the-structure-tutorials` for an explanation of the principles used to guide the way the tutorial section is written.
