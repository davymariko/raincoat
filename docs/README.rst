About this documentation
========================

This documentation is entirely based on the template written by
`Daniele Procida <https://divio.com>`_ as presented in his wonderful
`talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg>` delivered at
several conferences including PyconAu 2017.

The copied template was from https://github.com/evildmp/daniele-procida-starter-docs
at commit 73d1ef91c436e3dcd0fa5c2d18f20e7831efd564.

The ``Makefile`` is the entry point for every "doc" operation, mainly
``make install`` to install the needed tools and ``make html`` to
generate the documentation.
