About the Documentation Starter Kit
===================================

The `Documentation Starter Kit <https://divio.com>`_ aims to solve several of
the key problems software project maintainers who need to manage the project's
documentation. It's a set of files to help software documentation authors make
a quick start, with a clean, well-structured project.

The project includes tooling to set itself up, and build the documentation,
publishing it as a self-contained HTML website.

It's easy to use as the basis for your own, real documentation, and is ready to
be published on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_.

The kit uses:

* ReStructured Text (RST)
* Sphinx
* Git and GitHub
* Read the Docs
* A prescribed documentation structure

All you need to do is make a copy of the Kit, and start editing and adding your
own material to it. When you're ready, send it to Read the Docs, and you'll
have good looking, easy-to-maintain and feature-rich public documentation for
your project.

Even with minimal quantity of actual documentation content, you'll have
a structure and tools that will help you add to it in rational, obvious ways,
and will ancourage others to contribute to it too.

Go straight to the :ref:`tutorial` for a complete step-by-step guide through the
entire process.

The kit was developed at `Divio <https://divio.com>`_ by Daniele Procida.
